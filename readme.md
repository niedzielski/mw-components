Vue.js user interface components for search.

## Development

### Quick start

```bash
npm i && npm run build
```

[NVM] is used to specify Node.js version but any recent version usually works.

[NVM]:  http://nvm.sh

### NPM scripts

[Configure your NVM shell environment] (e.g., `nvm install $(<.nvmrc) && nvm use`) before executing
these scripts.

- `install` / `i`: install project dependencies. 
- `build`: compile source inputs to bundle outputs.
- `test` / `t`: build the project and execute all tests. Anything that can be validated by
  automation before publishing runs through this command.

The remaining undocumented scripts are utilities and not expressly supported workflows.

## Design goals

- Thoroughly typed. Accurate typing improves comprehension for tooling and programmers.
- Performant and intelligently divided with minimal required dependencies.
- Well tested and robust.
